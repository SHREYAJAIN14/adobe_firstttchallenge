INTRODUCTION\nW\nound assessment is important healthcareconcerninmedicalandclinicalresearch.Thereisstrongjustificationforregular\nwound inspection i.e. wound assessment is necessary to monitor treatment outcome, infection identification andevaluation\nof treatment accuracy. Clinical researcher believed that wound monitoring proficiently basedonhistologicaltrackingofthe\nmorphological changes in tissues. Therefore, comprehensive wound assessment need regular clinical observation[1,2].But\nwith technology inventions of current era it became emerging need to convert clinical centric wound health care to patient\ncentric health care by providing IoT based health care application composed of sensors, device, analysis modules and\npatients. [3]. Therefore, many currentresearchesbyITResearchersfocusedonfactorseffectingwoundhealingandemerged\nwith such solution for assessment of wound by measuring physical characteristics of wound e.g. wound size, wound color\nusingIoT.[4-9].\nAlthough, measurement of wound visual appearance play vital role in woundassessment,buttherearemanyotherinternal\nand external wound factors which may have major impact on wound healing i.e. hydrationlevel,skintemperature,oxygen\nsaturation [1], environmental factors (air temperature, air humidity, presence of microbes,dustetc.)[10].Therefore,wound\ncare domain required such wound monitoring system thatmayalsoconsiderwoundinternalandexternalfactorsforwounds\nassessment, rather thanjustwoundappearance.Inhealthcaredomaintherearemanyapplicationswhichdesignedtomonitor\ndifferent diseases but wound care domain still required such techniques and sensing system which can identify different\nfactorsofwoundareaincludingtemperature,bloodpressure,oxygenandinfectionstatusofwoundusingbiosensor[11].\nIn healthcare domain researchers proposed a lot of wearable devices for health centric task i.e. disease diagnosis bytaking\npatient body parameters as input, these wearable devices having biggest limitation that they were only used for disease\ndiagnosis and unable to read data frompatientbodythereforethesedevicesunablemonitordiseasecondition,drugresponse\nby analysis of real time patient body characteristic [12].A lot of IoT based health care solutions based on sensors used for\ndetectionofmedicalconditions,efficientlywithbearinglowcostandeasyaccess,howevertheymayfaceissuesdueto\nVOLUMEXX,2019 1"

There are two major components of IWAS i.e.\nsensing part and analyzing part. We implemented sensing part by ARDUINO and analyzing part in MATLAB. In this\nsection,wedescribedimplementationofIWAScomprehensively.\nA. MeasuringWoundFactorsbySensingSystem:\nFirst component of proposed IWAS is sensors based system which we used to measure different wound factors for wound\nassessment. We implemented this portionwithArduinobasedcircuitwhichwedesignedbyhardwarecomponentsdiscussed\nin section 3.3. Sensing system collected wound factors and used standard values of body temperature, air temperature, air\nhumidityandSpO2.\n1) MEASURINGBODYTEMPERATURE\nTemperature is major factor included in woundcharacteristicswhichboost/delayhealingbydirectlyandindirectlyeffecting\nother wound characteristics.

It is recognized widely that oxygen\nplays a significant role in all stages of wound healing. For all type of skin wound body need bacterial defense, cell\nproliferation, collagen synthesis and angiogenesis. British Journal of Dermatology reported that oxygen major role is its\nability to produce energy. Howard M. Kimmel et al. [41] studied the effect of oxygen on wound healing and they define\noxygen as key factor in wound healing. All cell on wound need energy for reproduction. Therefore, they need adequate\namount of oxygen to generate energy. In absence of proper oxygen, a condition known as hypoxia occurs which can slow\nandevenstopthehealingprocess.\nTABLE5.\nSTANDARDOXYGENRANGE\nStandard Oxygen%\nNormal 95-100\nHypoxemia <95%\nHigher >100%\nTABLE6.\nWORKINGRULESOFPROPOSEDIWAS\nRule AirHumidity Wound\nAirTemp WoundTemp SpO2\nNo AssessmentClass\n1 Normal Normal Normal Normal Good\n2 High Dry Normal Normal Good\n3 High Normal Normal Normal Good\n4 Low Normal Normal Normal Good\n5 Low Wet Normal Normal Good\n6 High Dry Hyperthermia Normal Satisfactory\n7 Low Wet Hyperthermia Normal Satisfactory\n8 Low Wet Hyperthermia Hypoxemia Satisfactory\n9 High Dry Normal Hypoxemia Satisfactory\n10 Low Wet Normal Higher Satisfactory\n11 High Dry Normal Higher Satisfactory\n12 High Wet Hyperpyrexia Normal Alarming\n13 Low Dry Hyperpyrexia Normal Alarming\n14 High Wet Hyperpyrexia Hypoxemia Alarming\n15 Low Dry Hyperpyrexia Hypoxemia Alarming\n16 High Wet Hyperpyrexia Higher Alarming\n17 Low Dry Hyperpyrexia Higher Alarming\n18 Low Dry Hypothermia Higher Alarming\n19 High Wet Hypothermia Higher Alarming\n20 High Wet Hypothermia Hypoxemia Alarming\n21 Low Dry Hypothermia Hypoxemia Alarming\nAlarming\n22 Low Dry Hypothermia Higher\nMoreover, Oxygen is necessary for angiogenesis, which coulddefineasnormalprocessofnewbloodvesselformationfrom\nexisting one.

ConclusionsandFutureWork\nIn clinical research wound assessment techniques usually focusedonphysicalappearanceofwounde.g.woundsize,wound\ncolor, wound shape etc. However other factors also play significant role in healing process therefore they may need to\nmeasure for wound assessment. These factors included atmosphere of wound, temperatureofwoundandamountofoxygen\nsupplied to wound site. These factors can not only influence wound healing but they also showed correlation with other\nwound characteristic as well i.e. air humidity level correlated with air temperature which in turneffectwoundtemperature,\nsimilarly oxygen levels correlated with wound hydration level and vice versa. For efficient wound assessment system, itis\nnecessary to focus on these factors. In current research we proposed an intelligent wound assessment system based on\nsensors. Our proposed solution consists of two modules, first module composedofArduinobasedcircuit,whichweusedto\nsense wound factors by using sensors LM35, MAX30100 and DHT22 for wound temperature, oxygenation levels, air\ntemperature and air humidity respectively. In second module we used entropy based decision tree for efficient decision\nmaking of wound assessment status based on measurement of wound factors. Our proposed decisiontreemoduleclassified\ninput in to three possible assessment classes based on their values i.e. good, satisfactory and alarming. Decision tree used\nVOLUMEXX,2019 9"

In MATLAB complex tree used entropy and information gain to choose feature for best split, which in turn\nincreased decision tree accuracy rate as results showed that decision tree trained with 96.4 % accuracy rate. We applied\nproposed IWAS on 5 patient data and got 89-94% precision rate and 98-100% recall, which showed that proposed system\nproducedmaximum94%correctnessand100%completenessrate.\nCurrently IWAS used decision tree for decision making, but there are many other intelligent dataminingtechniqueswhich\ncan be used for decision making.
